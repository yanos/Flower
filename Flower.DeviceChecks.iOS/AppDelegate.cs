    //    run that decodes correctly but reports nothing is indistinguishable
    //    from a hang. A file in a container the script can find its way into
    //    has no such failure mode.
    //  - stdout, which a device run launched through devicectl --console
    //    shows live.
    //  - the screen, so a run on a phone with no cable attached is readable
    //    by the person holding it.
