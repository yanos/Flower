# Builds flower_ffmpeg.dll for Windows, and puts the FFmpeg DLLs it needs
# beside it.
#
# Unlike macOS and Linux there is no FFmpeg on this machine to find and no
# pkg-config to ask, and unlike iOS and Android there is no reason to spend
# half an hour cross-compiling one: FFmpeg publishes usable Windows builds, and
# the LGPL variant of them is configured exactly the way Flower needs (no
# --enable-gpl, no --enable-nonfree) and ships the libraries as separate,
# replaceable DLLs, which is the same shape the licence obligation takes on
# every other desktop. So this script downloads one rather than building it.

#
# The result lands in native/ffmpeg/artifacts/windows/, which is where
# FfmpegNative.Resolve looks - five DLLs rather than one, since the façade
# imports avformat, avcodec, avutil and swresample. Nothing copies them
# anywhere else; a packaged Windows app would have to, and does not yet.
#
# See ../README.md, whose licensing section applies here as much as anywhere:
# what makes this build distributable is that FFmpeg stays a set of DLLs the
# user can replace, and that Flower carries the source offer.
