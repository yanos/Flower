# Builds every flower-ffmpeg façade this machine is able to build, and says
# plainly what it skipped and why.
#
# It exists because nothing else builds the façade. `dotnet build` compiles the
# managed bindings in Flower/Audio/Ffmpeg/ and never touches flower_ffmpeg.c -
# the desktop artifact is found at runtime by FfmpegNative.Resolve, and the
# mobile ones are checked-in binaries the heads merely package. So editing the
# C changes nothing at all until the right per-platform script is re-run by
# hand, and there are five of those with different prerequisites. CI has always
# had that list; a developer machine had to keep it in its head.
#
# What it is not is a cross-compiler. A façade needs an FFmpeg for its target,
# and where that comes from differs per platform - pkg-config on macOS and
# Linux, a repo-built static prefix on the phones, a pinned download on
# Windows. So a host builds what it can reach and skips the rest: a Mac gets
# macOS, iOS and (with an NDK) Android; a Linux box gets Linux and Android;
# Windows is PowerShell and MSVC and is not reachable from here at all. Getting
# all five is a matter of running this on more than one machine, which is what
# CI does.
#
# A skip is not a failure. Everything attempted runs even if an earlier one
# broke - a missing NDK must not hide that macOS built fine - and the exit code
# is about what was attempted.
#
#     native/ffmpeg/build-all.sh                 # everything this host can do
#     native/ffmpeg/build-all.sh macos ios       # just these
#     FLOWER_FFMPEG_REBUILD=1 …/build-all.sh     # rebuild the mobile FFmpeg too
#
# The mobile targets each cross-compile FFmpeg itself first (build-ffmpeg.sh),
# which is tens of minutes the first time. Both of those are idempotent - an
# existing prefix is left alone unless FLOWER_FFMPEG_REBUILD is set - so the
# ordinary run after that is just the façade, which is one translation unit.
